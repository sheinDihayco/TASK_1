      <p>
          React is a popular JavaScript library developed by Facebook for building user interfaces, especially single-page applications. It uses a component-based architecture, allowing developers to create reusable UI components. With JSX syntax, developers can write HTML-like code within JavaScript, making UI code more readable. React's virtual DOM ensures efficient updates and rendering, enhancing performance. Its unidirectional data flow and declarative approach make the code predictable and easier to debug.
